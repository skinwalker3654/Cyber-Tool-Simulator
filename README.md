# Cyber Security Hacking Tool (C Edition) ðŸš€

A **fun & educational simulation tool** written in **C** that mimics various cyber security operations.
This is **not a real hacking tool** â€” it generates randomized results for **learning, testing, or demonstration purposes only**.

---

## Features

The tool simulates multiple modules with flashy UI effects:

- **Network Scan** â€“ discover "hosts" and open ports
- **Password Bruteforce** â€“ dictionary + mask mode simulation
- **DDoS Flood** â€“ fake botnet attack visualization
- **Keylogger View** â€“ mock keystroke monitoring
- **Email Breach Scan** â€“ fake leaked credentials
- **Exploit Scanner** â€“ simulated vulnerabilities
- **SSH Brute Force** â€“ fake SSH login attempts
- **Packet Sniffer** â€“ network packet capture simulation
- **Crypto Wallet Scanner** â€“ fake blockchain wallet balances
- **SQL Injection Scan** â€“ web form vulnerability simulation
- **WiFi Password Cracker** â€“ fake WiFi password recovery
- **Malware Deployer** â€“ fake payload deployment
- **Steganography Scanner** â€“ detect hidden content in images
- **Ransomware Emulator** â€“ encrypt files simulation with progress bars

ðŸ’¡ All outputs are randomized, **no real attacks occur**.
